Don’t expect to get an offer if you say:

1. ‘I’m a motivated self-starter.’

2. ‘In five years, I hope to be in your position.’

3. ‘I didn’t like my previous boss.’

4. ‘My biggest weakness is that I’m a perfectionist.’

5. ‘Can you tell me more about the company?’

6. ‘What do your perks and benefits look like?’
