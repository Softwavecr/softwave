# Softwave Technology

__2011:__ Founded Costa Rica tech startup. Overcame initial financial challenges, financed launch with US startup work. Grew to 5 retainers ($3k/mo), 2 staff, 4 contractors. Managed client IT(POS,WiFi,Sotheby's),built ISP/supplier ties. Transformed to ‘jack of all trades’: business, negotiation, team lead. Learned startup adaptability managing growth, securing contracts, daily problem solving, and providing critical tech support to the local economy. But my true achievement? Balancing intense work with daily dawn and dusk surf sessions, a personal victory.
