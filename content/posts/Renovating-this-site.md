## New year, bring it on!

The short term goal is to update the site to show the highlights of what has happened since 2021, fix broken links and outdated information.

I found a page by Glen Thomas Berger that explains how to build a site like this, and it is at least 96% the same I did. I am giving a 4% chance of things being implemented differently only to minor details that I may not remember at the moment.
