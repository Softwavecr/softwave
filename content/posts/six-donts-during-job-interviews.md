## Do not expect to get an offer if you say  

1. I am a motivated self-starter.

2. In five years, I hope to be in your position.

3. I did not like my previous boss.

4. My biggest weakness is that I am a perfectionist.

5. Can you tell me more about the company?

6. What do your perks and benefits look like?

Any surprise?
