# Welcome Go

Today I created a new project for polyglot coding practice of simple nature. 

I will increase complexity gradually. The idea behind this project is to dust-off my coding skills and learn some new languages and features of this trending tools(go, py) at the same time.

The difference between this project and the Hackerrank one is, for the latter, I will only use actual HR challenges, whereas polydojo is not restricted to any source or kind of exercise.
