## Abstraction
Only making certain aspects of the program accessible from outside of the class (private methods).

## Encapsulation
Wrapping up the methods and attributes of the class within the class itself.

## Inheritance
A class' ability to inherit attributes and methods from other classes (keeps your code DRY).

## Polymorphism
Classes that inherit from each other being able to invoke the same method and receive a different result.
